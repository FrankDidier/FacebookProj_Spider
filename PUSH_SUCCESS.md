## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Revoke Your Token Now!

**Your GitHub token has been exposed!**

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Find** the token that starts with `[REDACTED - Token removed for security]`
3. **Click "Revoke"** or delete it
4. **This token is compromised** and should not be used

### Why?
- The token was exposed in this conversation
- Anyone with this token can access your repositories
- Revoke it immediately for security

### Future Pushes:
- Generate a new token when needed
- Or better: Use SSH keys (more secure)
- See `SECURITY_WARNING.md` for details
